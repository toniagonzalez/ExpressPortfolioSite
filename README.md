# ExpressPortfolioSite
This app uses Node.js, Express and Pug templates to create a portfolio site that features JavaScript projects I have completed in Treehouse's FullStack JavaScript TechDegree. I created a JSON object to hold all of the project data and a static server for the 'public' folder containing images and stylesheets. I added styling to the provided CSS(background images, text color, fonts, custom thumbnail images, and a favicon). I also created github pages for each of the projects and provided links to the live projects in addition to links to the github repository.


To install dependencies, use the package manager [npm]https://www.npmjs.com/:

```
npm install
```

To start a development server:

```
npm start
```
